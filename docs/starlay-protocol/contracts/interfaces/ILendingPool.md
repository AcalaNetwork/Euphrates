# ILendingPool









## Methods

### borrow

```solidity
function borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf) external nonpayable
```



*Allows users to borrow a specific `amount` of the reserve underlying asset, provided that the borrower already deposited enough collateral, or he was given enough allowance by a credit delegator on the corresponding debt token (StableDebtToken or VariableDebtToken) - E.g. User borrows 100 USDC passing as `onBehalfOf` his own address, receiving the 100 USDC in his wallet   and 100 stable/variable debt tokens, depending on the `interestRateMode`*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| asset | address | The address of the underlying asset to borrow |
| amount | uint256 | The amount to be borrowed |
| interestRateMode | uint256 | The interest rate mode at which the user wants to borrow: 1 for Stable, 2 for Variable |
| referralCode | uint16 | Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man |
| onBehalfOf | address | Address of the user who will receive the debt. Should be the address of the borrower itself calling the function if he wants to borrow against his own collateral, or the address of the credit delegator if he has been given credit delegation allowance* |

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode) external nonpayable
```



*Deposits an `amount` of underlying asset into the reserve, receiving in return overlying lTokens. - E.g. User deposits 100 USDC and gets in return 100 lUSDC*
